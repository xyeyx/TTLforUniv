# TTLforUniv
This project will be a simplistic prototype of university teaching capacity management system. TTL stands for Transparency in Teaching Load: there will be easy query workload, work load distribution, payment, and functions like accountability in workload assignment will be added. The backend is a simple SQL relational database -- already the mature industrial standard in the business world. As a prototype, it is based on the minimalistic SQLite3.
