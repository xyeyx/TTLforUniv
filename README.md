# TTLforUniv
This project will be a simplistic prototype of university teaching capacity management system. TTL is not the typical TTL in ICT terminology but stands for Transparency in Teaching Load. It will allow easy query in workload, workload distribution, working credit accrediation. Functions like accountability in workload assignment will be engineered and added. The backend is a simple SQL relational database -- already the mature industrial standard in the business world. As a prototype, it is based on the minimalistic SQLite3 and will have a simple web-based query and editing interface.
